\title{Estimate the fixed coeficient of a calibration dataset.}
\usage{
calib_coef(DS, LowerRange = 0, UpperRange = 200, MyModel = "lm")
}
\arguments{
\item{DS}{is a data.frame with 6 columns (RunTechnician, ConcentrationLabel, ConcentrationValue, CalibCurve, ReplicateNumber,
Responses). Responses column might have been filled by simulation or with the experimental results.}

\item{LowerRange}{A  real number corresponding to the lower bound of the range in which the modelisation applies.}

\item{UpperRange}{A  real number corresponding to the upper bound of the range in which the modelisation applies.}

\item{MyModel}{A string of character indicating the type of model to apply. Currently only "lm" for linear model.}
}
\value{
Resp A list with the estimate of the fixed effects, the fixed effect estimates of all calibration curves and data usefull for diagnostics)
}
\description{
Calib_coef return a list with the estimation of the fixed coefficients and model data for diagnostics.

\examples{

RespCalib = calib_coef(DS = calib_data,LowerRange=0,UpperRange=200,MyModel='lm')
